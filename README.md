# Proveably Random Raffle Contracts

[Contract deployed on Sepolia Testnet Link](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xf8361daa040c8ecceebbffeb43b54fb9fb277990#code)
​
## About
​
This code is to create a proveably random smart contract lottery.
​
## What we want it to do?
​
1. Users should be able to enter the raffle by paying for a ticket. The ticket fees are going to be the prize the winner receives.
2. The lottery should automatically and programmatically draw a winner after a certain period.
3. Chainlink VRF should generate a provably random number.
4. Chainlink Automation should trigger the lottery draw regularly.
